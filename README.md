# new-project-cli

**First of all, you need to install package by type:**

```
  npm i -g @tsivinsky17/new-project
```

After that, you can use it.

---

There is a command template below:

```
  new-project <PROJECT_TYPE> <PROJECT_NAME>
```

For now, there is only one project type and you can use it by type this command:

```
 new-project react-webpack <PROJECT_NAME>
```

That allows you to create a new project based on React and Webpack with Sass as stylesheet.
